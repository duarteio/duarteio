### Hello! 👋 I'm Igor (he/him)

- 👨🏻‍💻 I solve biological problems with computational tools.
- 🧬 I deal mainly with Illumina sequencing data.
- 🧐 Most interested in 🦀 cancer epigenetics and 🧫 microbial community analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Nanopore sequencing data analysis, to try and combine long- and short-read data.

- 🧩 Here, you'll find pieces of code I put together during my work routine to deal with (meta)genomics, metabarcoding and (meta)transcriptomics.
- 📊 I also publish here the repositories of the original research articles I contributed.
- 🚀 Towards reproducible science!
